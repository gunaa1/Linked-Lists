# Linked-Lists

Recently, I was learning about various different data structures. Through the beauty of encapsulation, I did not have to understand the inner workings of any specific data structure, but only needed to know how to use/interact with them. However, the best way to learn in CS is by doing in my opinion, so I decided to make my own library of Linked Lists from scratch. This list includes single and double linked node_based, queues, stacks, and binary trees. Additionally, I made sure these data structures have almost the full capabilites of the real implementations through the use of genric classes and extreme code efficiency.

## To access the code:

1) Download the code by pressing on "Code" and then the "Download ZIP" button.
2) Extract the zip file an open the files in an IDE of your choice.
3) You now have full access (in addition to viewing, you can run the code as well) to all of the code.
